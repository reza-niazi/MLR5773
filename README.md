# MultiLinear Regression
This was an R package made for a course in applied regression analysis. It includes functions relevant to performing regression with both the
frequentist (classical) and Bayesian approaches. The classical method uses a Bootstrap algorithm for finding regression coefficients, and the Bayesian approach uses existing packages that utilize MCMC. It also has a Shiny app that can be used to check if given data satisfies the assumptions of regression along with a nice interactive plot that can be used to see how changing the regression coefficients affects the fit of the regression plane with the 3D scatterplot of data. See the README.pdf file for full details and examples of code output.
