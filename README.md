# MLR5773
This was an R package made for a course in applied regression analaysis. It includes functions relavent to performing regression with both the
frequentist (classical) and Bayesian approach. The classical method uses a Bootstrap algorithm for finding regression ceofficients, and the Bayesian approach uses existing packages that utilize MCMC. It also has a Shiny app that can be used to check if given data satisfies the assumptions of regression, and it has a nice interactive plot that can be used to see how changing the regression coefficients affects the fit of the regression plane with the 3D scatterplot of data.
